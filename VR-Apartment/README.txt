# Build an Apartment Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 2017.1.0p4
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0

## Running Platform
- Android

## Reflections
-The project took me 2 weeks to complete
-One thing that I liked was learning more about the Unity engine and how to manipulate objects.
-One thing that I found challenging was test all the possible settings of baking lights to get the most optimal configuration for the scene while playing on my phone.

## Reviewer Note
-I followed the instructions for quality|player settings based on the updated content for lights on Unity 2017, but Unity was saying "Warning! Using antialiasing on mobile device may decrease performance severely. You can change the mobile quality settings in 'Projects -> Quality Settings'.".
Even tho' the lesson did used antialiasing. I did not noticed any frame drop tho.
